How the software works:

	-You will first need to have the billboard server working for the control panel and viewer to work properly
	-The control panel is a GUI software that users can interact with
	-The control panel can be used to create, edit and delete billboards, create, edit and delete users, and schedule billboards for the viewer
	-The viewer is GUI that cannot be interacted with, the viewer runs in fullscreen and displays the current billboards

Installation guide can be found in the file directory
